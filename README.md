# Starship Config

This is my configuration I use for the [starship prompt](https://starship.rs).

I use this primarily for git and seeing what directory I'm in. I don't really care for any of the other features, so ymmv!

# Installation

Install starship: `brew install starship`

Copy the starship.toml to `~/.config/starship.toml`

[Configure](https://starship.rs/guide/) your prompt (I use [fish shell](https://fishshell.com)).

# Style Notes

If you want the exact prompt I have, use Meslo LG M DZ as the terminal font and [Nord](https://www.nordtheme.com) as the colour scheme. The terminal shown is [iTerm](https://iterm2.com) configured with the minimal style.

# Thanks

[Starship](https://starship.rs) for making a pretty rad prompt.
